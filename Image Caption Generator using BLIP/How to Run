                                      How to Run the Gradio Image Caption Generator 

1. Install Required Packages 
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run: 
        pip install torch torchvision 
        pip install transformers 
        pip install gradio 
        pip install pillow 

2. Save Your Script 
    Save your code into a Python file, for example: 
        image_caption_app.py 
    Make sure it includes the gr.Interface(...) and interface.launch() parts (which it already does). 

3. Run the Script 
    In your terminal, run: 
      python image_caption_app.py 

4. Open in Browser 
    After running, Gradio will display a message like: 
      Running on local URL: http://127.0.0.1:7860/ 
    Open this link in your browser. 

5. Use the Interface 
    • Upload any image (JPG, PNG, etc.) 
    • The model will process it and generate a caption. 
    • The caption will appear below the image.
